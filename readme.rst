CAS_Resolver
=====

CAS resolver is a python script to obtain the CAS identifier of a molecule from its name.

It can use either the cirpy package based on the Chemical Identifer Resolver (CIR). 
If this method is fast it often fails so it is possible to use the PubChem search which is much more robust but longer.
